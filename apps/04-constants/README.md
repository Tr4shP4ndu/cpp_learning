# 04-constants

- The `const` keyword is used to define constants. Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once they are assigned. This ensures that the value remains read-only throughout the program. It's a common convention to name constants in all uppercase letters.

## Build and run (from repository root)

Run these from the repository root:
  - make build app=04-constants
  - make run app=04-constants

Binary path: build/04-constants/bin/04-constants

Alternative (from inside this folder):
  - cd app/04-constants
  - make run

This uses the per-app Makefile and still outputs to the centralized top-level build/ folder.
