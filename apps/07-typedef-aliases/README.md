# 07-typedef-aliases

- The `typedef` keyword is used to create an alias for an existing data type. This can improve code readability, reduce typos, and make the code easier to maintain. While `typedef` is still widely used, the modern `using` keyword is often preferred, especially when working with templates.

## Build and run (from repository root)

Run these from the repository root:
  - make build app=07-typedef-aliases
  - make run app=07-typedef-aliases

Binary path: build/07-typedef-aliases/bin/07-typedef-aliases

Alternative (from inside this folder):
  - cd app/07-typedef-aliases
  - make run

This uses the per-app Makefile and still outputs to the centralized top-level build/ folder.
