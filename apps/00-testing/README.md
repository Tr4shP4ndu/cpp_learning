# 00-testing

Minimal C++ app scaffold.

## Build and run (from repository root)

Run these from the repository root:
  - make build app=00-testing
  - make run app=00-testing

Binary path: build/00-testing/bin/00-testing

Alternative (from inside this folder):
  - cd app/00-testing
  - make run

This uses the per-app Makefile and still outputs to the centralized top-level build/ folder.
