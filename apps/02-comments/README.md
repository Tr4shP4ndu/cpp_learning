# comments

This is how you write comments in the cpp file

## Build and run (from repository root)

Run these from the repository root:
  - make build app=comments
  - make run app=comments

Binary path: build/comments/bin/comments

Alternative (from inside this folder):
  - cd app/comments
  - make run

This uses the per-app Makefile and still outputs to the centralized top-level build/ folder.
