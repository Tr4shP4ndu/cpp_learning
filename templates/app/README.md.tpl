# __APP_NAME__

Minimal C++ app scaffold.

## Build and run (from repository root)

Run these from the repository root:
  - make build app=__APP_NAME__
  - make run app=__APP_NAME__

Binary path: build/__APP_NAME__/bin/__APP_NAME__

Alternative (from inside this folder):
  - cd app/__APP_NAME__
  - make run

This uses the per-app Makefile and still outputs to the centralized top-level build/ folder.
